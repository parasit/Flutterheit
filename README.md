# flutterheit
A Flutter client for DrGezunheit (another RPG related Go project). 

It's (will be) a user friendly Game Master helper with monsters, players, npc, items, etc. databases, dices thrower,  and any other tools which helps to play Pen&Paper RPGs.

## a little explanation
This project is created as an exercise to help me learn Flutter and Dart. Expect bugs and strange solutions.
Remember I'm just learning :)
